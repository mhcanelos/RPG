# RPG Database Analysis

This project utilizes an SQL database named RPG, which contains characters, weapons, items, and other related entities, as the foundation for various data analysis tasks. Python functions have been developed to establish connections to the RPG SQL database via SQLite3, allowing seamless interaction and manipulation of the database. Additionally, SQL queries are employed within the Python environment to retrieve, update, and manage data within the RPG database, enabling efficient data handling and processing for various tasks and analyses.

## Features

- **SQL Database**: The project is based on an SQL database named RPG, containing characters, weapons, items, and related entities.
- **Python Functions**: Python functions have been developed to establish connections to the RPG SQL database via SQLite3, facilitating easy interaction and manipulation of the database.
- **SQL Queries**: SQL queries are employed within the Python environment to retrieve, update, and manage data within the RPG database, enabling efficient data handling and processing.

## Usage

1. **Establish Connection**: Use the provided Python functions to establish a connection to the RPG SQL database.

```python
import sqlite3

# Establish connection
conn = sqlite3.connect('rpg_database.db')
```

2. **Execute SQL Queries**: Execute SQL queries using the established connection to retrieve, update, or manage data within the RPG database.

```python
# Example: Retrieve all characters from the database
cursor = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM characters")
characters = cursor.fetchall()
```

3. **Perform Data Analysis**: Utilize SQL queries and Python code to perform various data analysis tasks based on the RPG database.

```python
# Example: Calculate the total number of characters in the database
cursor = conn.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM characters")
total_characters = cursor.fetchone()[0]
print("Total characters:", total_characters)
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
```

2. Ensure you have Python and SQLite3 installed on your system.

3. Run the Python scripts provided in the repository to interact with the RPG database.
